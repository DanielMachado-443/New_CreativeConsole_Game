## Repository description

- It's a C# .Net simple console game, made in a simplified MVC(model, view, control) scheme, with a couple of unique AND hidden rules and mechanics that remind ourselves from the 90's years, where only the personal enthusiasm and curiosity of being able to improve your own skills were enough to get happy. Also, this little project has an extremely easy and simple console engine, like Lego, that can be used in a large range of ideas. Feel free to use that as you wish. =)

## Start

- In order to start the game you must have Visual Studio installed with .Net Core package - Windows eviroment

## How it Works

<a title="LibQuality API">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0qrlbmB.png"/>
</a>

1. The user send a GET request to "/search" with the "project" he wants to search and his "user" on query:
(project only accepting "vue" or "react" for now)

```sh
$ curl --request GET '${HOST}:${PORT}/search?project=${project}&user=${user}'
```

2. The application will try to find data from this project on database.
  - If there is no data from this project on database, the application will follow the step <b><u>3</u></b>.
  - If it finds anything, the application will now check if this data have more than 1 day
    - If the data have more than 1 day, the application will update this data to inactive on database, and follow the step <b><u>3</u></b>
    - If the data have less than 1 day, the application will follow the step <b><u>6</u></b>

3. The application will send a GET request for Github API with the following data:

```sh
$ curl --request GET 'https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:${repository}+state:open&sort=created&order=desc&per_page=100'
```
  - For this, the response from github is something like that:

  ```diff
    {
      "total_count": 527,
      "incomplete_results": false,
      "items": [ {...}, {...}, ... ]
    }
  ```

  - The property "items" is a array of objects, with each one of them a issue. However, even with the "total_count" property, 
  the github api only returns 100 (at max) items for each page. So, our application will identify the "follow" link no headers and continue to send requests to 
  next pages until all are done to get all items.

  <div>
    <a title="link-headers">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CcTVwiw.png"/>
    </a>
  </div>

4. After all reqs finish, the application will map all results and make the calculations needed for "avgAge" (Average Age in days) and "stdAge" (Standar Deviation in days) based on Today's Date.
  - After that, the project data will be saved on "project" table on database.
  <div>
    <a title="project-data">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eACwzOe.png"/>
    </a>
  </div>
  - And a log of that search will be saved on "searchLog" table on MySQL
  <div>
    <a title="log-data">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/q48gdUn.png"/>
    </a>
  </div>

5. The application will return to user to user the informations requested on response body

  ```diff
    {
      "status": 200,
      "message": "OK",
      "result": {
          "repository": "vuejs/vue",
          "issues": 527,
          "avgAge": 547,
          "stdAge": 31
      }
    }
  ```

## TODO

- Statistics route/controller
  - The day by day data is already on MySQL, we need to create a route to organize this data for user consumes.
- Integrated Unit Tests
  - Mock express, to test the start of application, routes and controllers
  - Mock Sequelize (MySQL), to test connections, repositories, models and queries
- Automated Tests
  - The main goal is to create automated tests with BDD, using libs like SuperTest, Mocha and Chai. This tests need to be user tests, and can entender on CI/CD to ensure to block deploy if some issue pass through unit tests during build.
- CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab..)
- Redis 
  - Used as a "cache" to remove the dependency from MySQL as fresh data. Also to ensure the application will not crash and can be continue to retrieve data for users if something happens with database.
